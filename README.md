## Need for a Centralized Service
Centralized services are essential for managing shared data and logic across different parts of an Angular application, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.

## Creating a Service
Services in Angular are created using the `@Injectable` decorator. They can be provided at the root level or within specific modules or components.

## How Not to Provide a Service
Avoid providing services in multiple places unnecessarily, as it can lead to multiple instances and unexpected behavior.

## Using Angular Dependency Injection Mechanism
Angular's dependency injection (DI) mechanism allows you to inject services into components and other services, promoting modularity and testability.

## Using Alternative DI Syntax: `inject()`
The `inject()` function provides an alternative way to inject dependencies, especially useful in standalone functions and factory providers.

## Outsourcing & Reusing Logic with Services
Services are ideal for outsourcing reusable logic, such as data fetching, business rules, and state management, making your components cleaner and more focused.

## Multiple Injectors
Angular supports multiple injectors, allowing you to control the scope and lifetime of service instances.

## Multiple Ways of Providing Services
Services can be provided in different ways, including in the `providers` array of modules, components, or using the `providedIn` property in the `@Injectable` decorator.

## Injecting Service into Service
Services can be injected into other services, enabling complex dependency graphs and promoting code reuse.

## Analyzing DI with Angular Dev Tools
Angular Dev Tools provide insights into the dependency injection graph, helping you understand and debug your application's DI setup.

## Custom DI Tokens & Providers
Custom DI tokens and providers allow you to inject non-class values and configure how dependencies are resolved.

## Preparing a Non-class Value for Injection
Non-class values, such as configuration objects, can be prepared for injection using custom providers.

## Injecting Other Values (Not Services)
Angular's DI system can inject various types of values, not just services, enhancing flexibility and configurability.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive guide to working with Angular services and dependency injection, covering essential concepts and best practices.
